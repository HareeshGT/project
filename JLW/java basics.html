            <h1 class="heading-1">What is Java?</h1>

            <p>
                Java is a high-level, versatile, object-oriented programming language and computing platform. It was
                developed by Sun Microsystems (now a subsidiary of Oracle Corporation) and released in 1995. Java is
                known for its platform independence, meaning that Java programs can run on any device that has a Java
                Virtual Machine (JVM) installed, regardless of the underlying hardware and operating system.
            </p>
<br>
            <h2 class="heading-2">Key Features of Java:</h2>
            <div class="space">
                <ol>
                    <li><strong>Object-Oriented Programming (OOP):</strong> Java follows the principles of
                        object-oriented programming, including encapsulation, inheritance, polymorphism, and
                        abstraction.</li>

                    <li><strong>Platform Independence:</strong> Java achieves platform independence by compiling source
                        code into an intermediate form called bytecode. This bytecode is then executed by the Java
                        Virtual Machine (JVM).</li>

                    <li><strong>Write Once, Run Anywhere (WORA):</strong> The platform independence of Java allows
                        developers to write code once and run it on any device that supports Java.</li>

                    <li><strong>Rich Standard Library:</strong> Java comes with a comprehensive and extensive standard
                        library that provides functionality for various tasks such as input/output, networking, data
                        structures, and more.</li>

                    <li><strong>Automatic Memory Management:</strong> Java features automatic garbage collection,
                        managing memory by identifying and reclaiming unused objects.</li>

                    <li><strong>Security:</strong> Java incorporates various security features to create a secure
                        computing environment. The JVM runs Java bytecode in a sandboxed environment.</li>

                    <li><strong>Multithreading:</strong> Java supports multithreading, allowing concurrent execution of
                        multiple threads within a program.</li>

                    <li><strong>Large Community and Ecosystem:</strong> Java has a vast and active developer community,
                        contributing to an extensive ecosystem of libraries, frameworks, and tools.</li>

                    <li><strong>Versatility:</strong> Java is used in a wide range of applications, including desktop
                        applications, web applications, mobile applications, enterprise systems, and embedded systems.

        <!--features of java-->
        <div>

            <h1 class="heading-1">Features of Java</h1>

            <h2 class="heading-3">1. Platform Independence:</h2>
            <p>Java achieves platform independence through its "Write Once, Run Anywhere" (WORA) principle. Java source
                code is compiled into an intermediate bytecode, which is then executed by the Java Virtual Machine
                (JVM). Since the JVM is platform-specific, Java programs can run on any device with a compatible JVM,
                irrespective of the underlying hardware or operating system.</p>

            <h2 class="heading-3">2. Object-Oriented:</h2>
            <p>Java is designed as an object-oriented programming language, emphasizing the use of classes and objects.
                This approach promotes modular and organized code, encourages code reuse, and facilitates the modeling
                of real-world entities using encapsulation, inheritance, and polymorphism.</p>

            <h2 class="heading-3">3. Simple and Easy to Learn:</h2>
            <p>Java's syntax is straightforward and resembles other C-based languages, making it easy for programmers to
                learn and understand. The language intentionally avoids complex features, which contributes to its
                simplicity and enhances the learning curve for beginners.</p>

            <h2 class="heading-3">4. Robust:</h2>
            <p>Java incorporates strong compile-time checks and runtime checks to ensure robustness. This reduces the
                chances of errors, enhances program stability, and helps identify potential issues during development
                rather than at runtime.</p>

            <h2 class="heading-3">5. Secure:</h2>
            <p>Java is designed with security in mind. It includes features such as a secure runtime environment,
                automatic memory management, and built-in security checks to protect against common security threats,
                including viruses, unauthorized access, and memory-related vulnerabilities.</p>

            <h2 class="heading-3">6. Multithreading:</h2>
            <p>Java supports multithreading, allowing the concurrent execution of multiple threads within a single
                program. This feature is crucial for developing efficient and responsive applications, particularly in
                scenarios where tasks need to be performed simultaneously.</p>

            <h2 class="heading-3">7. Architecture-neutral:</h2>
            <p>Java's architecture-neutral bytecode allows programs to be executed on any platform that has a compatible
                JVM. This bytecode is generated during compilation and can be run on any device with a JVM, enhancing
                the portability of Java applications.</p>

            <h2 class="heading-3">8. High Performance:</h2>
            <p>Java achieves high performance through its Just-In-Time (JIT) compiler. The compiler translates Java
                bytecode into native machine code at runtime, optimizing execution speed and making Java suitable for
                performance-sensitive applications.</p>

            <h2 class="heading-3">9. Distributed Computing:</h2>
            <p>Java provides features and APIs for developing distributed applications. Objects can be distributed
                across different machines, and Java Remote Method Invocation (RMI) allows methods to be invoked on
                remote objects. This facilitates the development of applications that can operate seamlessly in a
                networked environment.</p>

            <h2 class="heading-3">10. Dynamic:</h2>
            <p>Java supports dynamic loading of classes at runtime. This allows classes to be loaded as needed,
                enhancing flexibility in program execution. Dynamic features contribute to better memory management and
                efficient use of system resources.</p>

            <h2 class="heading-3">11. Rich Standard Library:</h2>
            <p>Java comes with a comprehensive set of libraries and APIs in its standard library (Java Standard Edition
                API). These libraries cover a wide range of functionalities, including data structures, networking, file
                I/O, and GUI development. Developers can leverage these libraries to streamline application development
                and reduce the need for writing code from scratch.</p>

            <h2 class="heading-3">12. Community Support:</h2>
            <p>Java has a large and active community of developers worldwide. This community provides a wealth of
                resources, including forums, documentation, tutorials, and open-source projects. The collaborative
                nature of the community fosters knowledge sharing and support for developers of all skill levels.</p>
